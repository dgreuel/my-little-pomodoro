My Little Pomodoro
==================
My Little Pomodoro is a Pomodoro timer and task tracker for OS X.  Screenshots and more info can be found [here](http://voltagesoft.com/my-little-pomodoro).

I'm releasing this since My Little Pomodoro is no longer available on the Mac App Store and someone may find it useful.  Please keep in mind that I am not providing **any** kind of support regarding this project, so feel free to fork it and work on it as you wish.

The app should build in XCode 4 with some tweaks (I haven't touched this since XCode 3 was out), but you'll need Interface Builder from XCode 3 to edit some of the nibs since the project uses some BWToolkit UI elements.
