  <h2>The Pomodoro Technique and My Little Pomodoro</h2>
  
  <p>The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the 1980s.  It uses a 25 minute work period, called a "pomodoro", followed by breaks.</p>
  
  <h3>There are five basic steps to using the technique:</h3>
  <ol class="instructions">
		<li>Choose a task to be accomplished, and write it on a piece of paper.
		<li>Set the timer to 25 minutes.</li>
		<li>Work on the task until the timer rings, then put a mark next to the task.</li>
		<li>Take a short break, between 3-5 minutes.</li>
		<li>Every 4 Pomodoros, take a long break (15-30 minutes).</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p><b>My Little Pomodoro</b> aims to be the Pomodoro timer, and the paper and pen used for recording tasks, that you use while working.  And just in case the 25/5/15 minute split does not work for you, My Little Pomodoro lets you adjust these timer lengths.</p>
