  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  
  <p>To get started with My Little Pomodoro, select the type of timer you want (Pomodoro, short break, long break), and that's it!  The timer will begin counting down.</p>

  <p>At this point, you can stop the timer by clicking the <b>Stop</b> button.  A stopped timer can either be resumed by clicking on the <b>Start</b> button, or reset by clicking on the <b>Reset</b> button.</p>
  
  <p class="note"><span>Note:</span> You can also use the keyboard shortcut <b>⌘S</b> to stop or start a timer.  <b>⌘R</b> resets a stopped timer.</p>

  <p>When the timer finishes, you will be alerted by audio alarms and notifications (which are customizable).  After the timer finishes, you can again select the type of timer you would like.</p>
  
  <p>You can also use My Little Pomodoro to keep track of the tasks that you are working on.  See <a href="../html/tasks-and-stats.html">Tasks and Stats</a> for more information.</p>
