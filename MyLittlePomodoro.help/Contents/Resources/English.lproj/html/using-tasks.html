  <h2>Tasks</h2>
  
  <p>Keeping track of your tasks while working is an important part of The Pomodoro Technique, and My Little Pomodoro aims to make task management straightforward and puts it entirely in the hands of the user.  Using My Little Pomodoro's task management is also completely optional.</p>

	<div class="note">
		<span>Note:</span> If you do opt to use the built-in task management features, adding a new task is simple, but there are a few things to keep in mind:
		<ul>
			<li>A task must be selected for any statistics to be recorded.</li>
			<li>It is up to you to add or select a new task once you are finished with the previous task.</li>
			<li>
        Adding, removing, or selecting a new task while the timer is stopped will end the current timer.
        <a name="TaskChangeWhileTimerIsStopped"></a>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you follow the Pomodoro Technique exactly as it's prescribed, once the timer begins, it has to ring.  The exception to this is if "you finish an activity in the first five minutes of the Pomodoro and you feel like the task was actually already finished during the previous Pomodoro and revision wouldn’t be worthwhile" (The Pomodoro Book, pages 7-8), in which case you can end the Pomodoro early and not include it in the Pomodoro count.  This is why My Little Pomodoro ends the current timer if you stop the timer and try to change/add/remove tasks.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
		</ul>
	</div>

  <h3>To add a task:</h3>
  <ol class="instructions">
		<li>Add a task.
			<ul>
				<li>click on the Add Task button (the + button) in the lower left hand corner of the application window
				<li>or choose <span class="menuitem">Tasks</span> > Add Task</li>
				<li>or type <b> ⌘T</b></li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Type a name for the new task.<li>
		<li>Hit the return key</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>After adding a task, you can start the timer.  A task <i>must</i> be selected for any statistics to be kept about the task.</p>

	<p>Once you have completed a task, click on the checkbox to the left of the task name to mark it as completed.</p>

  <h3>To remove a task:</h3>
  <ol class="instructions">
		<li>Select the task that you want to remove.</li>
		<li>Remove the task.
			<ul>
				<li>click on the Remove Task button (the - button) in the lower left hand corner of the application window
				<li>or choose <span class="menuitem">Tasks</span> > Remove Task</li>
				<li>or type <b>&#x2318;&#x232B;</b></li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ol>

	<p>You can also remove all completed tasks.</p>
	<h3>To remove all completed tasks:</h3>
  <ul class="instructions">
		<li>choose <span class="menuitem">Tasks</span> > Remove Completed Tasks</li>
		<li>or type <b>&#x2325;&#x2318;&#x232B;</b></li>
	</ul>
	
	<br>
	<h2>Stats</h2>
	<p>You will notice that as you work (and a task is selected), some basic statistics will be displayed for the selected task.  You will see the date the task was created, the number of completed Pomodoros, the total number of completed Pomodoro minutes, and the total number of stops for that task.</p>
